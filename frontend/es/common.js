The most uniquely expressed benefit is in the form of passive-Ethereum income generated by fees imposed on other players liquidating their positions into, or out of the game. These fees are distributed to token holders as a form of share-based return. The resulting volume-based income adds an expressive third dimension to the standard price/time calculations that are ubiquitous in cryptocurrency today.</p>"
